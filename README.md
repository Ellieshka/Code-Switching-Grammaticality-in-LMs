# Code-Switching-Grammaticality-in-LMs
This repository contains all data, code, and analysis scripts for the study on how language models process bilingual code-switched sentences. We investigate the presence of grammatical knowledge using surprisal measures, minimal pairs, and the XLM-Roberta language model.
